## üîπ Powder Deposition Using DEM

The powder deposition process in LPBF involves random and stochastic particle
packing. To represent the powder bed accurately, it is modelled as a
collection of discrete particles rather than a continuous medium. Particle
motion due to interactions with the recoating mechanism and neighbouring
particles is resolved using **LIGGGHTS¬Æ** [2], an open-source Discrete Element
Method solver.

In this tutorial, a rain deposition method is used to generate the powder bed.
Particles are introduced at the top of a domain with rigid boundaries and
allowed to settle under gravity onto the build plate. A monodisperse particle
size distribution is used, selected to reflect the experimentally measured
distribution for SS316L powder.

The particle size distribution is shown below [1]:

## üß± Powder Bed Generation with LIGGGHTS¬Æ

The powder bed used in this tutorial has already been generated
using **LIGGGHTS¬Æ**. Therefore, **it is not necessary to regenerate it to
run the case as provided**.

However, for users interested in reproducing or modifying the powder
deposition process, the necessary input files and scripts are included in the
`DEM_small/` directory.

We provide here a brief overview to help users get started, but **this is not
a complete installation or usage guide**. For full instructions and advanced
configuration options, please refer to the official LIGGGHTS¬Æ documentation:

[LIGGGHTS¬Æ Manual and Installation Guide](https://www.cfdem.com/media/DEM/docu/Manual.html)

### üîß Installing LIGGGHTS¬Æ (Basic Setup)

See the instructions given in the main [`README.md`](../../../README.md) file.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the DEM Simulation (Optional)

The characteristics of the particles in the powder bed are defined in the file:

```bash
DEM_small/input.liggghts
```

To generate the powder bed, run the following script:

```bash
cd DEM_small
./Allrun
```

This will execute the DEM simulation using LIGGGHTS¬Æ and produce the file:

```bash
DEM_small/post/location
```

This file contains the particle positions and must be copied to the `constant/`
directory of the OpenFOAM case before running `laserBeamFoam`:

```bash
cp DEM_small/post/location LPBF_small/constant/
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the LPBF Simulation

Once the `LPBF_small/constant/location` file exists, the LPBF simulation can be
 run by executing the `Allrun` script in the main `LPBF_small` directory:
The characteristics of the particles in the powder bed are defined in the file:

```bash
./Allrun
```

This `Allrun` script performs five tasks:

- Copies the `initial` directory to `0`
- Creates the mesh by running `blockMesh`
- Sets the initial metal volume fraction field using `setSolidFraction`, which
  reads the particle locations from `constant/location`
- Rotates the mesh using `transformPoints`
- Run the `laserbeamFoam` solver

# How to cite

If you use one of these solvers for a publication, please cite the appropirate reference (see [Publications](../publications/publications.html) page)
in the following way:

Example (laserbeamFoam):

> Version 2.0 — LaserbeamFoam: Laser ray-tracing and thermally induced state transition simulation toolkit
> Thomas F. Flint, Joseph D. Robson, Gowthaman Parivendhan, Philip Cardiff
> SoftwareX, Volume 21, February 2024
>  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2023.101612 


The corresponding BibTeX entry:

```bibtex
@article{Cardiff2025, 
    author =     {Thomas F. Flint, Joseph D. Robson, Gowthaman Parivendhan, Philip Cardiff},
    title =      {Version 2.0 — LaserbeamFoam: Laser ray-tracing and thermally induced state transition simulation toolkit},
    journal =    {SoftwareX},
    year =       {2024}, 
    publisher =  {Elsevier},
    volume =     {25}, 
    number =     {108}, 
    pages =      {101612},
    doi =        {10.1016/j.softx.2022.101299}, 
    url =        {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101299}
}
```

In addition, depending on the functionality selected, there may be additional
relevant references (the solver output will let you know!).
